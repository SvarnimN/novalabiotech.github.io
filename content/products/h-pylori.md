The H. pylori Antibody Rapid Test Kit is a qualitative immunoassay designed for the detection of antibodies to Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) in human serum or plasma. This test kit provides a convenient and reliable method for the diagnosis of H. pylori infection.

**Intended Use**: The H. pylori Antibody Rapid Test Kit is intended for healthcare professionals and laboratory use as an aid in the diagnosis of H. pylori infection. It is not intended for self-testing at home.

**Principle**: The H. pylori Antibody Rapid Test Kit is based on the principle of lateral flow immunoassay. The test utilizes specific antigens to selectively detect antibodies to H. pylori in the test sample. The test cassette contains a membrane strip pre-coated with recombinant H. pylori antigens and colored particles conjugated with anti-human IgG antibodies. When the test sample is added, if antibodies to H. pylori are present, they bind to the conjugate, forming colored lines in the test regions. The control line serves as a procedural control to validate the test results.

**Storage and Stability**:
- The H. pylori Antibody Rapid Test Kit should be stored at room temperature (2-30ºC).
- The kit components are stable through the expiration date printed on the sealed pouch.
- The test cassettes must remain in the sealed pouches until use.
- Do not freeze the test kits.
- Do not use beyond the expiration date.

**Precautions**:
- For in-vitro diagnostic use only.
- Use the test kit in a well-ventilated area.
- Handle all specimens and test components as if they contain infectious agents.
- Follow standard precautions for the disposal of used test components.
- Wear protective clothing, such as laboratory coats and disposable gloves, when handling specimens.
- Read the instructions carefully before performing the test.

**Procedure**:
- Allow the test cassettes and specimens to equilibrate to room temperature (15-30ºC).
- Open the sealed pouches and remove the test cassettes.
- Add the sample (serum or plasma) to the sample well on each test cassette.
- Wait for the colored lines to appear in the result windows within the specified time.
- Interpret the results according to the instructions provided.

**Interpretation of Results**:
- Non-Reactive Result: The presence of both the control line and the test line indicates a non-reactive result, suggesting the absence of antibodies to H. pylori in the sample.
- Reactive Result: Only the control line appears, but the test line is absent. This indicates a reactive result, suggesting the presence of antibodies to H. pylori in the sample.
- Invalid Result: If no lines appear, or if only the test line appears without the control line, the result is invalid. Repeat the test with new kits.

**Limitations**:
- The H. pylori Antibody Rapid Test Kit is a screening test and should be confirmed by additional testing methods if the results are positive or inconsistent with clinical evidence.
- False-negative or false-positive results may occur due to various factors, including improper sample collection, storage, or handling.
- Results should be interpreted in conjunction with clinical information and other diagnostic findings.
