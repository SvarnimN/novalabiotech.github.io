Stool Antigen Test: This is the most common stool test to detect H. pylori. The test looks for antigens associated with H. pylori infection in the stool which is a confirmatory test for the presence of the bacteria. For the most reliable H. pylori stool
antigen test kit, contact Novala Biotech.

Stool PCR Test:

Stool polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test not only detects H. pylori but also identifies mutations that may resist common antibiotics. While more expensive, this test serves as a valuable alternative when precision is paramount. This test may not be available in all types of labs.

Breath Test:

Urea breath test utilizes tagged carbon molecules, offering a non-invasive method for detecting H. pylori. Suitable for adults and children over 6 years old, this test measures carbon release through breath analysis.

Scope Test:

In cases requiring deeper investigation, our healthcare providers may conduct an upper endoscopy exam. This invasive yet comprehensive test allows for direct visualization of the upper digestive tract, including the stomach and duodenum, with tissue samples taken for biopsy.

Testing Considerations:

 Novala Biotech emphasizes the importance of considering factors that may affect test accuracy, such as recent antibiotic use or medications like proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and H-2 blockers. Clear instructions will be provided regarding medication adjustments to ensure optimal test results.

Post-Treatment Evaluation:

Our diagnostic tests, used for initial diagnosis, are equally effective in confirming the successful eradication of H. pylori after antibiotic treatment. Retesting is generally recommended four weeks post-treatment to ensure accuracy.

Choose Novala Biotech for Precision and Accessibility: Our H. pylori antigen test kits revolutionize the diagnostic landscape, providing healthcare professionals and patients alike with reliable tools for efficient detection and monitoring of H. pylori infections.
