title: 'Debunking Combo Tests: NS1 Antigen test for Dengue confirmatory test'
---


In the dynamic realm of
healthcare, where precision and efficiency reign supreme, the selection of diagnostic tools plays a pivotal role, especially in unravelling the mysteries of diseases like dengue fever. Novala Biotech's NS1 antigen kits stand at the forefront, offering a streamlined solution that surpasses the complexity of combo test kits.

Dengue fever, notorious for its elusive symptoms, demands diagnostic tools that excel in accuracy. Novala Biotech's NS1 antigen kits have emerged as the leading choice, providing  singular and efficient solution that outshines the unnecessary complexities associated with combo test kits.

The Power of Single NS1 Antigen Kits:

National guidelines and research evidence emphasize that rRT-PCR or NS1 antigen in a single diagnostic specimen confirms dengue in patients, establishing the presence of the dengue virus. Unlike combo kits, which rely on Ig G and Ig M antibodies and may only detect the disease a week after viral infection, Novala Biotech's NS1 antigen kits offer a rapid and precise method for early identification.

The Science Behind Novala Biotech's NS1 Antigen Kits:

These kits operate on the detection of the non-structural protein 1 (NS1) of the dengue virus. The NS1
glycoprotein, secreted during the acute phase, serves as an ideal marker for swift and accurate diagnosis. In a healthcare landscape where resources are precious and decisions must be cost-effective, the case for single NS1 antigen kits becomes evident.

Global Alignment and Endorsement:

Novala Biotech's solution aligns with global health recommendations, including those by the Ministry of Health
in Singapore and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Encouraging physicians and lab technicians to reconsider the status quo, this solution advocates for the simplicity and effectiveness of NS1 antigen kits.

Championing Precision and Resource Optimization:

By choosing Novala Biotech's NS1 antigen kits, healthcare professionals can revolutionize the diagnosis of
dengue. This ensures timely and accurate results, benefiting both individual patients and the broader community. In the fight against dengue, let us champion tools that embody the future of healthcare—streamlined, effective, and unwaveringly focused on delivering the best outcomes for all.
