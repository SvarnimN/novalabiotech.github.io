As the vibrant energy of the 10th National Summit of Health and Population Scientists in Nepal enveloped the venue, our team from Novala Biotech embarked on a journey that would redefine our understanding of healthcare innovation. Led by Dr. Sunita Gautam, our esteemed Chairperson and Chief Technical Officer, and Mr. Kabin Maleku, our visionary Director of
Operations, we stepped onto the stage with a sense of purpose and determination.

It wasn't just a presentation; it was an embodiment of our commitment to advancing health equity in Nepal and beyond.

Nepal's healthcare landscape is marked by challenges – from limited access to essential supplies to disruptions caused by dependency on imports. The COVID-19 pandemic underscored the urgency of addressing these gaps. Inspired by the success of locally produced SARS-CoV-2 antigen RDT kits, we recognized an opportunity to make a difference. Our mission was clear – to develop and validate rapid diagnostic test kits that would empower our healthcare system and pave the way for a healthier, more resilient future. Our journey began with a spark of inspiration and a relentless pursuit of excellence. With the lateral flow immunochromatographic assay principle as our guiding light, we delved into the depths of scientific exploration. From the development of the kits to the rigorous process of internal validation using recombinant proteins and antibodies, every step was a testament to our unwavering commitment to quality and precision.

But it wasn't just about laboratory experiments; it was about bridging the gap between science and society. Collaborating with Central Diagnostic Laboratory (CDL) and Province Public Health Lab (PPHL), we collected clinical samples that would breathe life into our innovation. It was in those moments of validation – when the test results confirmed the accuracy and
reliability of our kits – that we realized the true impact of our work.

The journey was not without its challenges – from navigating regulatory requirements to overcoming technical hurdles. But with every obstacle, we grew stronger, more resilient. And as we stood before our peers, presenting reports of our validated rapid diagnostic test kits for human pregnancy, Dengue antigen, and Hepatitis B virus surface antigen, we knew that it was all worth it.![](/img/blogs/novala-nhrc-2.jpg)

Our experience at the summit was more than just a presentation; it was a testament to the power of perseverance and the
transformative potential of local innovation. As we look to the future, we see endless possibilities – new horizons to explore, new challenges to overcome. But with the spirit of innovation burning brightly within us, we are ready to embrace whatever comes our way.
