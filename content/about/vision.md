At Novala Biotech, our vision is to lead the way in healthcare development through research, innovation, and self-reliance. As a team led by a highly experienced Molecular Biologist, Biotechnologist and Pharmacist we firmly believe that research is the gateway to advancing healthcare practices.

We are committed to upholding the highest standards of quality, science, and innovation in everything we do. Our focus on accurate diagnostics is driven by the understanding that they play a critical role in improving patient outcomes and enabling informed medical decisions.

With a multidisciplinary team of researchers and scientists, we continuously push the boundaries of diagnostic technology. By embracing the latest advancements in molecular biology, we strive to develop reliable and precise diagnostic solutions that meet the evolving needs of the healthcare industry.

Our dedication to self-reliance is evident in our plans to establish a unique manufacturing facility in Nepal. This milestone achievement will not only mark a significant moment for our country's healthcare industry but also reflect our commitment to fostering innovation and scientific progress. By manufacturing locally, we aim to empower our nation to become self-sufficient in the field of in vitro diagnostics, reducing dependency on imports and making vital healthcare products more accessible to our fellow citizens.

We envision the manufacturing facility as a center of excellence where cutting-edge research and state-of-the-art technology converge. By investing in local manufacturing capabilities, we not only contribute to the growth of the domestic industry but also generate employment opportunities and nurture a skilled workforce in the field of molecular biology and diagnostics.

Through our unwavering dedication to quality, innovation, and self-reliance, we strive to transform Nepal into a hub of excellence in the field of in vitro diagnostics. We are driven by the belief that our efforts will revolutionize healthcare delivery, strengthen the healthcare infrastructure, improve disease management, and enhance patient care across the country.

Together, we can shape a healthier future, where evidence-based healthcare practices and high-quality diagnostic solutions positively impact the lives of countless individuals.
